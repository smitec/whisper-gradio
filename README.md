# Setting Up

Install ffmpeg and whisper as per the instructions at: https://github.com/openai/whisper

Install gradio via pip `pip install gradio`

Run `run.py`

If you are running this on a machine on your network and chrome wont let you use the microphone
because it isn't https, take a look at https://medium.com/@Carmichaelize/enabling-the-microphone-camera-in-chrome-for-local-unsecure-origins-9c90c3149339.
Don't do this for sites you don't control though.

That's it.
